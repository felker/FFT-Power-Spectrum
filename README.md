# FFT power spectrum visualizer

This program utilized discrete Fourier transformation to obtain the time-frequency-domain of a audio file. The result
can be explained as following:

- The top part of the program, we can see the raw amplitude-time data as it can be found in any `WAV` file.  
- The bottom part of the program is the output of the algorithm, combined with some waterfall effect.
